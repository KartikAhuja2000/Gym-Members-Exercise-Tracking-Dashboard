# Gym-Members-Exercise-Tracking-Dashboard

This project leverages Power BI to analyze and visualize various gym members' exercise behaviors, such as workout preferences, BMI, fat percentage, heart rate (BPM), and water intake. It provides insights into workout trends across age ranges and experience levels, helping gym owners, trainers, and fitness enthusiasts understand patterns and make data-driven decisions.

Features
- Workout Type vs. Age Range: Visualizes the distribution of gym members across different workout types like Cardio, Strength, HIIT, and Yoga based on their age range.
- Gender-based Workout Preferences: Analyzes workout preferences categorized by gender to understand workout engagement trends.
- Water Intake Trends: Shows the total water intake categorized by age range and experience level, offering insights into hydration patterns.
- BMI and Fat Percentage Correlation: Provides a correlation analysis between BMI and Fat Percentage to understand the relationship between body composition and workout habits.
- BPM Trends: Tracks Average BPM entries across different age ranges and experience levels to observe the intensity of workouts.

Key Insights
- Popular Workouts: Yoga and Strength Training dominate among individuals aged 36-45, with a noticeable drop in participation in the 56-65 age group.
- Water Intake: Members aged 15-25 tend to drink more water on average, with older members showing an increase in water intake, especially those with higher experience levels.
- BPM Trends: Experience Level 3 (more experienced members) typically show higher BPM across age ranges, suggesting they engage in more intense workouts.
- BMI and Fat Percentage: There is a weak negative correlation (-0.12) between BMI and Fat Percentage, indicating a minimal relationship, with other factors like muscle mass likely influencing body composition.

Technology Used
- Excel for ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) and Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- GitHub for project version control and sharing insights.
